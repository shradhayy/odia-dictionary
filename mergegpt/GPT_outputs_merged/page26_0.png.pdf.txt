Note: In the first output, for the word 'ewe' the Odiya translation is 'ଡାଡା GAB!' which seems to be incorrect, while in the second output, the Odiya translation is 'ଡାଡା ମେଣ୍ଡା' which is more accurate, so I considered the latter. Similarly, for the word 'fainting' in the first output, the Odiya translation is 'ମୋକ ବେଦ୍‌ ରୋରେ' which seems to be incorrect, while in the second output, the Odiya translation is 'ମୁହାଁ ହୋଇଥାଏ' which is more accurate, so I considered the latter. Moreover, for the word 'evil' in the first output the part of speech is 'Noun', while in the second output, it is 'Adjective'. Here, the correct part of speech is 'Noun' as per the context.
