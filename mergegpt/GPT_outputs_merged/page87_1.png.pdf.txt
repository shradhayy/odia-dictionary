It can be observed that the output 1 has some errors, like "young" has been classified as an adjective, whereas it's a noun. Similarly, "younger sister" has been classified as an adjective, but it's a noun. Output 2 has some additional entries, like "pen" and "younger sister's husband," which were not present in output 1. Therefore, after merging both the outputs, the errors have been reduced.
